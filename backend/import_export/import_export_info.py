    # Energy Import vs Export Dashboard
    
    ## Understanding Portugal's Energy Flow
    
    The Import vs Export Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Portugal's energy dynamics, showing how the country manages its energy resources through imports, exports, and domestic production. This visualization is crucial for understanding Portugal's energy independence and its role in the European energy market.
    
    ## What is Energy Import/Export?
    
    Energy import/export represents the flow of electricity between countries through interconnected power grids. This includes:
    
    - **Imports**: Electricity purchased from other countries when domestic production is insufficient
    - **Exports**: Electricity sold to other countries when domestic production exceeds demand
    - **Net Exchange**: The balance between imports and exports, indicating whether a country is a net importer or exporter
    
    ## Key Components of the Dashboard
