## üåü Overview

Eco AI.ly is an innovative startup project that combines artificial intelligence with environmental monitoring to drive sustainability and environmental awareness. Our platform leverages state-of-the-art predictive models, data analytics pipelines (initially developed in Jupyter Notebooks within the `backend/mvp/` directory, focusing on areas like live LSTM predictions for renewable percentage and power breakdown analysis), and interactive visualizations to help users monitor and make informed decisions about environmental metrics. Key areas include energy consumption, renewable energy production, carbon intensity, and cross-border energy exchange. The project also features a dedicated backend API service for delivering these predictions.

## üéØ Usage

### Streamlit Frontend

1. Ensure you are in the `frontend/streamlit` directory.
2. Activate your virtual environment.
3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (or the address shown in your terminal) in your web browser.
5. Use the sidebar to navigate through the different analysis dashboards:
   - Carbon Intensity Analysis
   - Renewable Percentage Tracking
   - Production vs Consumption
   - Import vs Export

### FastAPI Backend API

- The API service is designed to be run continuously (e.g., using Uvicorn or Docker).
- Endpoints are accessed via standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) from client applications or tools like `curl` or Postman.
- The primary endpoints are:
  - `GET /api/renewable-percentage`
  - `GET /api/carbon-intensity`
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at the `/docs` path of the running API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/docs`). This interface allows you to explore and test the API endpoints directly from your browser.
- For detailed information on API usage, request/response formats, and specific parameters, please refer to the `backend/api/CI_RP/README.md` and the live Swagger documentation.

## ü§ñ AI Models

Details about the AI models used in the Streamlit application and the backend API.

### Carbon Intensity Model (used in API and potentially by Streamlit via API)

- Architecture: LSTM Neural Network
- Input: 24-hour historical data
- Output: 6-class classification
- Test Accuracy: 90.9%
- Features: Real-time inference, uncertainty estimation

### Renewable Percentage Model (used in API and potentially by Streamlit via API)

- Architecture: LSTM Neural Network
- Input: 24-hour historical data
- Output: 6-class classification
- Test Accuracy: 90.9%
- Features: Real-time predictions, confidence scoring

### MVP Notebooks (`backend/mvp/`)

The Jupyter notebooks located in the `backend/mvp/` directory were instrumental in the initial phases of the project for:

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Understanding the structure and characteristics of energy data.
- **Model Prototyping**: Experimenting with different machine learning models, including LSTMs for time series forecasting (e.g., `Live_Predictions_LSTM_Renewable_Percentage.ipynb`).
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating relevant features for the predictive models.
- **Proof-of-Concept Analysis**: Validating the feasibility of predicting carbon intensity and renewable energy percentages, and analyzing power breakdown data (e.g., `Power_Import_Breakdown.ipynb`, `Power_Export_Breakdown.ipynb`).

These notebooks provide valuable insights into the data science workflow and the foundational steps that led to the development of the operational models used in the FastAPI service.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Development practices apply across the project, whether working on the Streamlit frontend, the FastAPI backend, or the MVP notebooks.

(Commands are typically run from the project root, or specific subdirectories like `frontend/streamlit` or `backend/api/CI_RP` as appropriate)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Example: Running pytest from the project root (if tests are structured there)
python -m pytest tests/ 

# Or, if tests are specific to a component, navigate to its directory:
# cd frontend/streamlit
# python -m pytest tests/ 
# (Adjust paths and commands based on your actual test setup)
```

### Code Formatting and Linting

Using Ruff (typically run from the project root or `frontend/streamlit`):

```bash
ruff format .
ruff check .
```

Using Black (if preferred, typically run from the project root or `frontend/streamlit`):

```bash
black .
```
